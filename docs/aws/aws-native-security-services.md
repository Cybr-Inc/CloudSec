## AWS-native security services

This page outlines AWS-native security services, meaning that they are available to use through your AWS account to help secure your AWS resources and environments.

Each of these services then offers a suite of features which won't be shown on this page but that will be explained in greater detail on other dedicated or relevant pages.

## Honorable mentions

These are either not considered strictly security services, they don't really fit in one of the other categories, or they are features of another service already mentioned. We're including them here because they're very important services/features that deserve a mention of their own:

- AWS Control Tower
- AWS Systems Manager (SSM)
- IAM Access Analyzer
