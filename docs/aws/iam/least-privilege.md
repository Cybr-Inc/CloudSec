## About Access Analyzer
AWS IAM Access Analyzer is a security tool designed to help organizations identify and manage unintended resource access in their AWS environments. It enables users to analyze permissions granted through IAM policies, resource policies, and Access Control Lists (ACLs) to determine if they result in overly permissive or unintended access to AWS resources.

## IAM Access Analyzer policy generation
Generate policies based on access activity by having IAM Access Analyzer review AWS CloudTrail logs and then automatically generate a policy template for the permissions that entity used during that time range.

!!! tip "Tips"

    - It's generally easier to start off granting more privileges than necessary (within reason) and then reducing over time since that will significantly reduce the number of times your team members reach out asking for more permissions. The risk here, of course, is granting far more permissions than necessary to people who might go rogue or who become compromised (leaked credentials, malware, phishing, etc) and then forgetting to go back and refine
    - Implement regular access audits and tweaking over time. This is not a one-and-done situation

## Check-access-not-granted
This feature and command of IAM Access Analyzer enables us to check newly created IAM policies against a deny list before we deploy the policy to AWS or production.

For example, you can run the command:
```
    aws accessanalyzer check-access-not-granted \
        --policy-document <value> \ // (1)!
        --access <value> \ // (2)!
        --policy-type <value> \ // (3)!
```

1. JSON policy to check. This can either be inline or a file path
2. Deny list of permissions. Can use shorthand or JSON
3. IDENTITY_POLICY or RESOURCE_POLICY (_[Identity vs. Resource policy](/aws/iam/about-iam/)_)

1. `:user/` tells us this is a user identity and not a role, which would instead be `:role/`

??? example annotate "Example command & output"

    ``` json
    [cloudshell-user ~]$ aws accessanalyzer check-access-not-granted \
        --policy-document file://policy.json \
        --access actions=iam:PutUserPolicy,iam:PutGroupPolicy \
        --policy-type IDENTITY_POLICY

    {
        "result": "FAIL",
        "message": "The policy document grants access to perform one or more of the listed actions.",
        "reasons": [
            {
                "description": "One or more of the listed actions in the statement with index: 1.",
                "statementIndex": 1 // (1)!
            }
        ]
    }
    ```

1. Indicating a match for iam:PutUserPolicy

## Check-no-new-access
This feature and command of IAM Access Analyzer enables us to check and see if new permissions are added to a policy before deploying to AWS. Think of it as a diff checker.

```
aws accessanalyzer check-no-new-access \
    --new-policy-document <value> \ // (1)!
    --existing-policy-document <value> \ // (2)! 
    --policy-type <value> // (3)! 
```

1. The new JSON policy document to check
2. The existing policy document to compare
3. IDENTITY_POLICY or RESOURCE_POLICY (_[Identity vs. Resource policy](/aws/iam/about-iam/)_)

??? example annotate "Example command & output"

    ``` json
    [cloudshell-user ~]$ aws accessanalyzer check-no-new-access \
        --new-policy-document file://new_policy.json \
        --existing-policy-document file://existing_policy.json \
        --policy-type IDENTITY_POLICY

        {
            "result": "FAIL",
            "message": "The modified permissions grant new access compared to your existing policy.",
            "reasons": [
                {
                    "description": "New access in the statement with index: 1.",
                    "statementIndex": 1
                }
            ]
        }
    ```
